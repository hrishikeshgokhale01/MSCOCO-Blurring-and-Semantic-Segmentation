# MSCOCO-Blurring-and-Semantic-Segmentation
This project synthetically generates a blurred image dataset using the MS COCO dataset as a source. It then attempts to perform semantic segmentation on all 80 classes of the newly generated dataset.

## To perform motion blurring on the MS COCO dataset:
Run the IPYNB file named "Final Dataset Generation Using Annotations (1)" in a Jupyter notebook or similar environment.
